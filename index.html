		<h1> Timmy Word </h1>
		<h2> Senior in BJA Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
		
		<p>
		I am a senior in highschool and i hope to study either computer science or IT when i get to college. I worked on custodial during the summer and bought myself an awsome new laptop.
		I spend most of my free time playing video games or learning something new on youtube.
		</p>
		<h3>Hobbies</h3>
		<p>
			Some of my other hobbies include small amounts of programming and building/repairing computers. if you ever have a broken computer either ask me for help or give it to me. I love taking computers apart and trying different ways to fix them.
			I havn't done much programming outside of a class, but i have experience in javascript, HTML5, CSS, and Visual Basic. I greatly enjoyed making a website for my computer class in highschool. It was to replace the <a href="Thomas, Word/brasspercussion.html">brasspercussion</a> website for BJU. It was one of many entries and it wasn't the best, but i'm proud of it.
			I don't like attending activities because i am anti-social and it gives me more time to play video games.

		<h4>Shows I like</h4>
			<p>
				I watch quite a few shows ranging from Dr. Who and star trek to Naruto and My Little Pony. My favorit genre of show is anime, but i am very selective about what i watch. It must be perfect.
				Though of course you are wondering about My Little Pony or MLP for short. MLP is by far my favorite show. I am what they call a brony. We even have our own website called <a href="https://www.equestriadaily.com/">equestria daily</a>. <b>No</b> i'm not gay. Just as you might love the show star trek and be a "trekkie", i am as well, i love MLP. My favorite pony is <a href="rainbowdash.png">Rainbowdash</a>.
